                    <p><strong>ARCHITtheque</strong> is an architectural firm focused on work that is relevant, design that is functional, be it new construction, adaptive reuse or renovations. The firm is devoted to provide thoughtful, quality and responsible design that addresses the requirement and aspiration, and is responsive to the social context.</p>
                    <p>Our collaborative approach engages the client and consultants during the entire design process. We also believe that contractors, crafts persons, vendors and all other participants can contribute at all levels of the design process. A patient, considerate process with respectful exchanges between all involved leads to the best decision making and the desirable outcome.</p>

We search to develop clear, distinguished work informed by the craft of construction, sustainability, culture and technology. It is our belief that every project is unique, thus each design response should be diverse and a reflection of the participants involved. It is our goal to exceed the client’s vision despite the most stringent budgets.</p>
